        <div class="post-snippet"><p>When we developed the first version of Algolia Search, we put a lot of effort
into developing a data update API. It worked like this: You could send us a
modified version of your data as soon as the change appeared, even if it
concerned only a specific part of a record. For example, this batch of
information could be the updated price or number of reviews, and we would only
update this specific attribute in your index.</p>
