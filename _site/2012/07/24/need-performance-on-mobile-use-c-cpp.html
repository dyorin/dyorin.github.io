  <div class="post"><p>When it comes to programming languages and performance, you can read all and
its opposite on the web. It’s definitely a very controversial topic!</p>

<p><strong>[Edit 15-Nov-2012]</strong> I had questions on <a href="http://redd.it/136hny">reddit</a> about the data-structures and algorithms we used. We develop an <a href="http://www.algolia.com">embedded search engine</a> for mobile, and tests were done on our own data-structure that is far more efficient than SQLite or other platform options for this use-case. <strong>[/Edit]</strong></p>

<p>For Algolia the story started when researching an instant suggest algorithm. I
used Java for two reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Main reason</strong>: our first client was using Java on Google App Engine</li>
  <li><strong>Secondary</strong>: at that stage, I was doing a lots of refactoring and Eclipse is very efficient for these tasks</li>
</ul>

<p>Once our algorithm was designed, I started to optimize performance on a
desktop computer (core I7 950). For this, I indexed all titles of the English
version of Wikipedia (4 millions titles). I optimized the Java code mainly by
reducing the number of allocations. All instant suggest queries were then
faster than 10ms.</p>

<p>As we planned from the begining to support iOS and Android, I needed to
optimize for high performance on mobile. I then ported the Java code to
Android and ended up with a few modifications (we needed to support old
Android versions which have not a full support of Java SDK).</p>

<p>In order to test performance, I created a small “demo” app: CitiesSuggest, a
mobile application based on Geonames database to look for a city name. I
filled the index with all places with a known population. In the end, the
database contained 270 000 city names.</p>

<p>As could be expected, the resulting application was quite sluggish on my
Galaxy S2. The worst queries could take more than one second of CPU.</p>

<p>I then applied all possible methods described in the <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/practices/performance.html">Anroid
documentation</a>
and was able to reduce the response time to 700ms for the longest queries.
This is better but still gives end-users an impression of sluggishness!
Fortunately, common queries worked well enough to present our very first demos
at <a href="http://blog.algolia.com/great-discussions-at-leweb12-london/">LeWeb’12 London</a>. I was subsequently able to improve the user experience a lot
by adding asynchronous support. At that point, we decided to start
implementing the objective-C version for iOS.</p>

<p>I started a new implementation fully done in objective-C from scratch without
any premature optimization. I then developed the same CitiesSuggest
application for iOS. I first got stuck with some basic UI stuff. For example I
needed to reimplement an UILabel that supports highlighting! The standard
UILabel does no support this, and other implementations like Three20 just have
too many dependencies (you can download AlgoliaUILabel on
<a href="http://github.com/algolia/UILabel">github</a>, I released  the code under Apache
licence). Once the UI was ready, I could see the actual performance was
catastrophic! Instant suggest queries were between 200ms and 10 seconds on an
iPhone 4S!</p>

<p>After profilling, I discovered that 95% of the time was spent in Objective-C
messaging and ARC. Actually, I have millions of calls to very small methods
with 1 or 2 lines of code, and I found a very good explanation in the internal
of objc_msgSend (mainly on <a href="http://www.mikeash.com/pyblog/friday-qa-2009-03-20-objective-c-messaging.html)">mikeask.com</a>. There is in fact a hash table
lookup behind objc_msgSend! This explains most of my performance problems.</p>

<p>To fix these problems, I started to replace all this low level objective-C
implementation by a C++ implementation with inlined methods. Eventually, I
finished with Objective-C code for high level classes while all the core was
C++.</p>

<p>This change has dramatically improved performance with instant-search queries
between 2ms and 90ms on a iPhone 4S. I struggled to find complex enough
queries to reach 90ms! This resulted in a very nice user experience with a
remarkably slick demo :)</p>

<p>After this succes, I decided to use the same C++ code on Android with Android
NDK. With this approach I reduced our maximum query time from 700ms to 80ms on
a Galaxy S2. But I was really disappointed by the Android display, as I did
not reach the same level of interactive experience that I had with iOS. The
display of results stays slower on Android, probably because I did not spend
enough time to optimize this part.</p>

<p>In the end, I lost a lot of time with Java and Objective-C trying to optimize
code when the real solution was to use C/C++. I am fully convinced that it is
just not possible to reach the same speed with Objective-C only or Java only.</p>

<p>And there is also another good property with C++ code: Blackberry supports
C++, and there is large chance that Windows Phone 8 SDK will support C++ when
released in a few weeks. Actually, I do not see any other alternative than
C/C++ when you are looking for performance on mobile devices, which is our
case :)</p>

<p>I hope this article will prevent you from spending as much time on
Java/Objective-C optimizations as I did.</p>
