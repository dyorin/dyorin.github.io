  <div class="post"><p>Time flies! I just realized we didn’t offer any feedback about our
participation in the Evernote DevCup back in July.</p>

<p>First of all, thank you so much for your support! We ranked 14th out of 174
contestants in public voting! That actually exceeded our expectations as we
aimed for the 20th position (so drinks are on Julien!)</p>

<p>But even with all of your support, we didn’t make it to the finals. We would
have loved to fly to San Francisco, but the <a href="http://blog.evernote.com/2012/07/27/announcing-the-2012-evernote-devcup-finalists/">six
finalists</a> all feature rich apps that merit their position. Congrats
guys, and good luck! The conference is in a couple of days now, and I can’t
wait to find out who will win the cup!</p>

<p>As for us, it was a truly great experience! Remember our
<a href="http://blog.algolia.com/were-participating-to-the-evernote-devcup/">post</a>
announcing our participation? Well, outside the <em>slight</em> frustration of not
going to SF, the couple of days we spent building the Search for Evernote app
was really worth it!</p>

<ul>
  <li>We were able to correct a few corner case bugs which this new use case highlighted. It’s always better to find them yourself than let app developers stumble upon them :)</li>
  <li>We developed a new feature enabling prefix search on all words.</li>
  <li>Our participation led to an improved awareness of the company and helped our SEO.</li>
  <li>We created a new demo of the search lib which is much more compelling than Cities Suggest in many situations. It is actually a bit more than a demo for some people - as of today, it has 317 active users on google play!</li>
</ul>

<p>That got us thinking… we may do this kind of contest again. But this time
we’ll aim higher!</p>
