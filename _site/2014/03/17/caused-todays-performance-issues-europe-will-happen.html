for some of the queries sent by your users.</p>

<p><em>Average latency for one of our European clusters on March 17th</em></p>

<p>As you can see above, our slowest average response time (measured from the
user’s browser to our servers and back to the user’s browser) on one of our
European clusters peaked at 858ms. On a normal day, this peak is usually no
higher than 55ms.</p>

<p>This was clearly not a normal behavior for our API, so we investigated.</p>

<h2 id="how-indexing-and-search-calls-share-the-resource">How indexing and search calls share the resource</h2>

<p>Each cluster handles two kinds of calls on our REST API: the ones to build and
modify the indexes (Writes) and the ones to answer users’ queries (Search).
The resources of each cluster are shared between these two uses. As Write
operations are far more expensive than Search calls, we designed our API so
that indexing should never use more than 10% of these resources.</p>

<p>Up until now, we used to set a limitation on the rate of Writes <em>per HTTP
connection</em>. There was no such limit for queries (Search); We simply limited
Write calls to keep search quality. To avoid reaching the Write rate limit too
quickly, we recommended users to Write by batching up to 1GB of operations per
call, rather than sending them one by one. (A batch, for example, could be
adding 1M products to an index on a single network call.) A loophole in this
recommendation was the origin of yesterday’s issues.</p>

<p>What happened yesterday is that on one of our European clusters, one customer
pushed so many unbatched indexing calls from different HTTP connections that
they massively outnumbered the search calls of the other users on the cluster.</p>

<p>This eventually slowed down the average response time for the queries on this
cluster, impacting our usual search performance.</p>

<h2 id="the-solution">The Solution</h2>

<p>As of today, we now set the rate limit of Writes <em>per account</em> and not per
HTTP connection. It prevents anyone from using multiple connections to bypass
this Write rate limit. This also implies that customers who want to push a lot
of operations in a short time simply need to send their calls in batches.</p>

<p>How would you batch your calls? The explanation is in our documentation. See
here for an example with our Ruby client: <a href="https://github.com/algolia
