  <div class="post"><p>At Algolia, we allow developers to provide a unique interactive search
experience with as-you-type search, instant faceting, mobile geo-search and on
the fly spell check.</p>

<p>Our Distributed Search Network aims at removing the impact of network latency
on the speed of search, allowing our customers to offer this instant
experience to all their end-users, wherever they may be.</p>

<h2 id="every-millisecond-matters">Every millisecond matters</h2>

<p>We are obsessed with speed and we’re not the only ones: Amazon found out that
100ms in added latency cost them 1% in sales. <a href="http://glinden.blogspot.fr/2006/11/marissa-mayer-at-web-20.html">The lack of responsiveness for
a search engine can really be damaging for one’s
business</a>. As
individuals, we are all spoiled when it comes to our search expectations:
Google has conditioned the whole planet to expect instant results from
anywhere around the world.</p>

<p><img src="./assets/user-experience.jpg" alt="user-experience" /></p>

<p>We have the exact same expectations with any online service we use. The thing
is that for anyone who is not Google, <strong>it is just impossible to meet these
expectations</strong> because of the network latency due to the physical distance
between the service backend that hosts the search engine and the location of
the end-user.</p>

<p>Even with the fastest search engine in the world, it can still take hundreds
of milliseconds for a search result to reach Sydney from San Francisco. And
this is without counting the bandwidth limitations of a saturated oversea
fiber!</p>

<h2 id="how-we-beat-the-speed-of-light">How we beat the speed of light</h2>

<p>Algolia’s Distributed Search Network (DSN) removes the latency from the speed
equation by <strong>replicating your indices to different regions around the world,
where your users are</strong>.</p>

<p>Your local search engines are clones synchronized across the world. DSN allows
you to <strong>distribute your search among 12 locations</strong> including the US,
Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Russia,
and Singapore. Thanks to our 12 data centers, your search engine can now
<strong>deliver search results under 50ms in the world’s top markets</strong>, ensuring an
optimal experience for all your users.</p>

<p><img src="./assets/DSN-b3ce122c790c492c2f2c8ddbabaae464.jpg" alt="DSN-b3ce122c790c492c2f2c8ddbabaae464" /></p>

<h2 id="how-you-activate-dsn">How you activate DSN</h2>

<p>Today, DSN is only accessible to our Starter, Growth, Pro and Enterprise plan
customers. To activate it, you simply need to go in the <strong>“Region” tab at the
top of your Algolia dashboard and select “Setup DSN”</strong>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.algolia.com/dsn/setup"><img src="./assets/shot.jpg" alt="shot" /></a></p>

<p>You will then be displayed with a map and a selection of your top countries in
terms of search traffic. Just <strong>select our DSN data centers on the map and see
how performance in those countries is optimized</strong>.</p>

<p>Algolia will then automatically take care of the distribution and the
synchronization of your indices around the world. End-users’ queries will be
automatically routed to the closest data center among those you’ve selected,
ensuring the best possible experience. Algolia DSN delivers an ultra low
response time and automatic fail-over on another region if a region is down.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.algolia.com/dsn/setup"><img src="./assets/dsn-shot.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>It is that simple!</p>

<p>Today, several services including HackerNews, TeeSpring, Product Hunt and
Zendesk are leveraging <strong>Algolia DSN to provide faster search to their global
users</strong>.</p>
