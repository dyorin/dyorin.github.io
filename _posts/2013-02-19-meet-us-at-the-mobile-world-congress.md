We'll be in Barcelona next week for the Mobile World Congress! Last year, more
than 67,000 attendees participated in the event.

We will use this opportunity to launch our new website along with a brand new
offer... Algolia for FREE! Stay tuned!

If you happen to be attending MWC too, ping me if you'd like to discuss over a
coffee :) (@dessaigne on twitter, or nicolas at algolia dot com).
